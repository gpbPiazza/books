# books

- Books repositories are where I will write about all books I have read. The main goal here is only do important annotations about the books for studies purpose, almost like a notebook but committed in my GitHub.

- Important! All words here are a mix of author's words, what i think and interpreted about the book. These notes should not be used as material to studied for others peoples. Would you like to learn about the books? I strong recommend you to read the book by your own and after that if read this notes it would be awesome to talk about the book, I would love that!
