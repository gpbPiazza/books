# FSA - Fundamentals of Software Architecture 
##### An Engineering Approach

By Mark Richards and Neal Ford

## Notes:

## Self-Assessment Questions:

### Chapter 1: Introduction:
1. What are the four dimensions that define software architecture?
    - Architecture consists of the ***STRUCTURE*** combined with ***ARCHITECTURE CHARACTERISTICS***, ***ARCHITECTURE DECISIONS*** and ***DESIGN PRINCIPLES***.
2. What is the difference between an architecture decision and a design principle?
    - Architecture decision is strict rule defined how the system should be constructed. For example, we have layered architecture style, we decided to follow the closed style, any layer shouldn't be able to pass through layers without the call the next beneath. Follow this rule is not recommendation! Is rule and should be followed. On the other hand, a design principle is used to provide guidance or a recommendation from the architecture to the developer team. For example, "whenever possible, leverage async messaging between services to increase performance"
3. List the eight core expectations of a software architect.
    - Make architecture decisions, continually analyze the architecture, keep current with the latest trends, ensure compliance with decisions, diverse exposure and experience, have business domain knowledge, possess interpersonal skills and understand and navigate politics
4. What is the first Law of Software Architecture?
    - There are no right or wrong answers in architecture only trade-offs.
### Chapter 2: Architecture Thinking
1. Describe the traditional approach of architecture versus development and explain why that approach no longer works.
2. List the three levels of knowledge in the knowledge triangle and provide and examples of each.
3. Why is it more important for an architect to focus on technical breadth rather than technical depth?
4. What are some of the ways of maintaining your technical depth and remaining hands-on as an architect?
