# books

-Books folder is where I will write about all books I have read. The main goal here is only to do important annotations about the books for studies purpose, almost like a notebook but committed in my GitHub.

- Important! All words here are a mix of the author's words, and what I think and interpreted about the book. These notes should not be used as material to study for other people. Would you like to learn about the books? I strongly recommend you read the book on your own and after that read these notes and come to talk about the book, I would love that! it would be awesome!
