# Grokking Algorithms
##### An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People

By Aditya Bhargava


# 1: Introduction to Algorithms
### Notes: none
### Exercises:
1.1 - 7
1.2 - 8
1.3 - Using binary search, we will have an execution time in Big O notation to O(log2 n)
1.4 - To search in all list we gonna have O(n)
1.5 - To search in all list we gonna have O(n)
1.6 - O(n)

# 2: Sort by Selection
### Notes: none
### Exercises:
2.1 - List
2.2 - List, as we have many insertions and an ordered list by the end of the list
2.3 - Array
2.4 - Insertions in array are slow, it is common to move all the array in memory to insert another element in the array, also to ensure ordination takes time.
2.5  
  - Ready: + slower than array and + faster than list O(1)
  - Write: + faster than array, because array should be ordered into A,B,C...Z O(n)

# 3: Recursion
### Notes: none
### Exercises:
3.1 â€“ Here are the following information we can starch from the image:
- The function sauda is called first with name = maggie
- The function sauda call the function sauda2 with name = maggie
- The current function been executed is sauda2
- After sauda2 finish his process, sauda will continue his process
3.2 - The call stack grows to infinite. Each program has a limit quantity of memory to stack of call stacks, and after the program reaches the limit will rise an error of stack overflow.
# 4: Quicksort
### Notes: 
- Euclides algorithm is awesome: find the bigger divisor common between two integers GCD(A,B), since GCD(A,0) = A and GCD(0,B) = B do:
  - A != 0
  - B != 0
  - So A/B and we can rewrite the division by A = B * Q + R
  - Execute GCD again To B and R, so B gonna be A and R B, until A or B be zero
### Exercises:
4.1 - All code are into folder chapter4Code
4.2 - All code are into folder chapter4Code
4.3 - All code are into folder chapter4Code
4.4 - All code are into folder chapter4Code
# 5: Tabela hash
### Notes: nones
### Exercises:
5.1 - Consistent
5.2 - Inconsistency
5.3 - Inconsistency
5.4 - Consistent
5.5 - Functions C e D
5.6 - Functions B e D
5.7 - Functions B, C e D
