# DDD - Domain Driven Design



###  Putting the Domain Model to Work

-  A model is a simplification of reality. It is an interpretation of reality that abstracts the aspects relevant to solving the problem at hand and ignores extraneous detail

### One. Crunching Knowledge

- Build a diagram, with any annotation or any just have something em common with the expertise of domain to you communicate what have you understand about the domain so he can give you feedback about it.

- When we have an unimportant model and an important have an interaction we should build a new model different from the other ones Eric called this as *Distilling the model*, given a example :
    - Model A is relevant and model B not. We have a new use case where we should use model B with model A. So this new use case is a new model, therefore we should make a modelAB or modelC to make clear the relevance of model A stay relevant e not "contaminated" with the irrelevance of B.

- Build a model -> test -> feedback -> repeat (massive experimentation)

### Two. Communication and the Use of Language
